<h2>Block Cookies Tool</h2>
<p>The Block Cookies tool blocks the sending and receiving of cookies. It can be used to test websites as if you have
cookies disabled in your browser. Note that web spiders (such as Google) often don't support Cookies so the tool can
also be used to simulate a spider's view of a website.</p>

<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>The Cookie header is removed from requests, preventing cookie values being sent from the client application (eg. web browser)
to the remote server. The Set-Cookie header is removed from responses, preventing requests to set cookies being received
by the client application from the remote server.</p>
