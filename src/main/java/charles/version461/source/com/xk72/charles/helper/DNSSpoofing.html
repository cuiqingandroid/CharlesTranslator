<h2>DNS Spoofing Tool</h2>
<p>The DNS Spoofing tool enables you to spoof DNS lookups by specifying your own hostname to remote address mappings. When a request
passes through Charles your DNS mappings will take precedence.</p>
<p>DNS Spoofing is useful for testing virtual hosted websites prior to a DNS change, as your browser will behave
as if the DNS change has been made. DNS changes often take up as long as 24 hours to take effect and without 
DNS Spoofing it can be very difficult to test what the website will
look like once the DNS change goes live.</p>

<p>You can map hostnames to an IP address or to another hostname, which will be looked up in DNS by Charles to find its IP address.</p>

<p>Hostnames may contain wildcards.</p>
