<h2>Location matching</h2>
<p>
The location match contains protocol, host, port and path fields that may be used to match the URL of the request.
Any of the fields may be left blank, in which case they will match any value.
</p>

<h3>Wildcards</h3>
<p>Wildcards are supported using either *, ? or character ranges [...]. The * matches zero or more characters. The ? matches one character.
Character ranges match one character in the range, eg. [a-z] or [aeiou].</p>

<h3>Paths</h3>
<p>
To match subpaths you must end your path with a /*. <b>NOTE:</b> In previous versions of Charles this was implicit, but it is now required.
</p>

<h3>Query</h3>
<p>
The query field matches the query string contents. Do not include the ? that starts the query string.
Note that the ? character is a wildcard character.
</p>
<p>
The query field can include wildcards, like the other fields, so you can do queries such as: "*page=1*" to match "page=1" anywhere
in the query string.
</p>

<h3>Common Uses</h3>
<p>
To match every request to a given host enter the hostname and leave the other fields blank.
To match every request to a given path on a host enter the hostname and the path ending with a /, leave the other fields blank.
To match every file with a given suffix on a host enter the hostname and /*.suffix, leave the other fields blank.

		<td>Matches all requests to host charlesproxy.com</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>

<p>Protocol and port matches can be added to the above to further narrow the location match.</p>
