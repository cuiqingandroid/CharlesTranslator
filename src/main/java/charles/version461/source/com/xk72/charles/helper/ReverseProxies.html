<h2>Reverse Proxies</h2>
<p>
A reverse proxy creates a web server on a local port that transparently proxies requests to a
remote web server. All the requests and responses on the reverse proxy may be recorded in Charles.
</p>
<p>
A reverse proxy is useful if you have a client application that doesn't support the use of
an HTTP proxy, or you want to avoid configuring it to use a proxy.
Create a reverse proxy to the original destination web server and then connect
the client application to the local port; the reverse proxy is transparent to the client
application and enables you to view the traffic in Charles where you previously may not have
been able to.
