<h2>Charles Root Certificates</h2>
<p>Charles uses its own Root SSL certificate for SSL requests through Charles to hosts enabled for <em>SSL Proxying</em>. The Root
certificate is generated automatically for each Charles installation.</p>

<p>Because Charles has signed the Root certificate itself, it won't be trusted by your browsers or applications. In order to use the 
<em>SSL Proxying</em> feature in Charles you therefore need to add the Root certificate for your copy of Charles to the 
trust-store on your OS, and perhaps in your browser.</p>

<p>Use the options in the SSL submenu in the Help menu in Charles to help install the Root certificate. You can install the certificate
on the current OS, or on remote devices or browsers.</p>

<p>To install the certificate in Mozilla Firefox, first configure Firefox to use Charles as its proxy then browse to chls.pro/ssl.</p>
