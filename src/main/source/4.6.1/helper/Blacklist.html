<h2>Black List Tool</h2>
<p>The Black List tool lets you block requests to selected locations. When a request is received by Charles that matches
a black listed location Charles blocks the request.  You can choose whether Charles will 
simply close the connection from the browser or return an error page (with a 403 response) to the browser.</p>
<p>There is also a White List tool that allows you to block all requests except those to selected locations.
If a request matches both the Black List and White List then it is blocked.</p>
