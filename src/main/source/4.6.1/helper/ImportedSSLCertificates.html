<h2>Server SSL Certificates</h2>
<p>Add PKCS#12 certificates for use when establishing SSL connections to clients.</p>
<p>When an SSL connection is established to a host that uses a matching server certificate Charles can use that certificate to establish the 
connection to the client.  If no matching certificate is found Charles must generate its own certificate which the client may not trust.</p>
