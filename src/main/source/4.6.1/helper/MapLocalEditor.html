<h2>Local Mapping</h2>
<p>A local mapping consists of a location match and the local directory from which to try to serve the matches.</p>
<p>Files are searched for in the local directory using the relative path. The relative path is the part of the
requested location left over after the path part of the match. This is best explained by the examples below.</p>

<p>Local mappings can be case-sensitive, so that regardless of whether your local filesystem is in fact
case-sensitive, the local mapping will always check the case. Case-sensitivity is the default.</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>
<p>The following examples help to explain how the location match relates to the local directory. The "local"
column is presented as relative to the local directory.</p>
<table border="1">

		<th>Host</th>
		<th>Path</th>
		<th>Request</th>
		<th>Local</th>
	</tr>

		<td>xk72.com/charles/index.php</td>
		<td>charles/index.php</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>xk72.com</td>
		<td>/charles/</td>
		<td>xk72.com/charles/index.php</td>
		<td>index.php</td>
	</tr>

		<td>/*.php</td>
		<td>xk72.com/charles/index.php</td>

		<td>/charles/*.php</td>
		<td>xk72.com/charles/index.php</td>
		<td>index.php</td>
	</tr>
