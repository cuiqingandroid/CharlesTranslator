<h2>No Caching Tool</h2>
<p>
The No Caching tool prevents client applications, such as web browsers, from caching any resources. Therefore requests are always
made to the remote website and you always see the latest version.</p>

<h3>About caching</h3>
<p>
Caching enables a client application, such as a web browser, to use a local copy of a response rather than
requesting it from the website. Caching is a very important part of the web as often the same resources are reused across multiple pages,
and having to reload each resource for each page would greatly slow down the browsing experience. However caching can mean
that you are not seeing the latest version of a resource, which is a problem when you're developing a web application -
you want to always see your latest changes.

<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>The No Caching tool prevents caching by manipulating the HTTP headers that control the caching of responses. The If-Modified-Since and If-None-Match
headers are removed from requests, Pragma: no-cache and Cache-control: no-cache are added. The Expires, Last-Modified and ETag headers are removed 
from responses and Expires: 0 and Cache-Control: no-cache are added.</p>
