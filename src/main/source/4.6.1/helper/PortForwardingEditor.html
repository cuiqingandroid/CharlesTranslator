<h2>Port Forwarding</h2>

<h3>Protocol</h3>
<p>Choose either TCP or UDP protocol for the forwarding. TCP is the most common Internet protocol; UDP is most commonly used for DNS or real-time applications
such as streaming.</p>

<h3>Start Port / End Port</h3>
<p>
The Start Port is the local port that you want to forward. If you want to forward a range of ports you can enter in an End Port, 
otherwise you may leave the End Port field blank.
</p>

<h3>Remote Host and Port</h3>
<p>
The remote host and port to forward to. If you have entered a range of ports using the End Port field the same range of ports
will be forwarded to using the remote port as the base port.
</p>

<h4>Listen On A Specific Address</h4>
<p>
If you want to specify the local address to listen on for the reverse proxy you can enable this option and enter in the IP address here.
This is useful if you want to run multiple network services on the same port but on different IP addresses on the same machine.
When this option is disabled the reverse proxy binds to all available local addresses.
