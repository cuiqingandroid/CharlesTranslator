<h2>OS Proxy Settings</h2>
<p>Charles can automatically configure your operating system's proxy settings. This will effect most
web browsers and applications on your computer, so they will you use Charles and thus their activity
will be visible in Charles.</p>

<p>You can enable the proxy configuration and then choose whether to configure the system to use Charles
as an HTTP proxy or SOCKS proxy, if the SOCKS Proxy is itself enables on the Proxies tab. See the Proxies
tab for information on the differences between HTTP and SOCKS.</p>

<p>The operating system proxy configuration can be enabled at start up, which is the default behaviour, so
that when you start Charles it is ready to be used. Alternatively you can disable this and enable the operating
system proxy settings manually or configure your browser and other applications manually to use Charles with
their own proxy settings configuration interface.</p>
