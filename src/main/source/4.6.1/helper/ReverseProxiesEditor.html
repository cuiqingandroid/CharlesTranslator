<h3>Local Port</h3>
<p>The port on the localhost to create the reverse proxy on. This field may be automatically populated with an available port. If there is
another application using that port you will receive a warning message when the reverse proxy starts.</p>
<p>eg. Given a local port of 8001 you will connect to the reverse proxy at http://localhost:8001/</p>

<h3>Remote Host and Port</h3>
<p>The hostname or IP address and port of the remote host that is the destination of the reverse proxy.
The remote port defaults to 80 which is the default port for HTTP.</p>
<p>eg. Enter a remote host of xk72.com and a remote port of 80, then http://localhost:8001/ will be as if you had connected
to http://xk72.com/</p>

<h3>Options</h3>

<h4>Rewrite Redirects</h4>
<p>
Redirect responses from the remote server will be rewritten to match the
reverse proxy source address. Defaults to on.
</p>
<p>Redirect responses from the remote server are to fully qualified
URLs even if they are within the same website. If the redirect is to the remote server address it is necessary to rewrite 
it to the reverse proxy local address, otherwise the client will use the redirect URL to
the remote host and thus no longer be connecting through the reverse proxy.
</p>

<h4>Preserve Host Header</h4>
<p>
The Host HTTP header is passed unchanged from the incoming request,
instead of the normal rewriting of the Host header to match the reverse proxy remote host.
Defaults to off.
</p>
<p>
Preserving the Host header is only necessary if you have specific requirements; it is not required for ordinary use.
</p>

<h4>Listen On A Specific Address</h4>
<p>
If you want to specify the local address to listen on for the reverse proxy you can enable this option and enter in the IP address here.
This is useful if you want to run multiple network services on the same port but on different IP addresses on the same machine.
When this option is disabled the reverse proxy binds to all available local addresses.
