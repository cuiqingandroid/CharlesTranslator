<h2>Viewer Content Type Mapping</h2>
<p>
The Viewer Content Type Mappings allow you to explicitly map selected locations to particular viewer content types.
This will automatically enable the appropriate content type specific viewers when viewing requests from those
locations.
</p>

<p>
Normally Charles attempts to automatically detect the appropriate viewer content type based upon the content of the
request or response, usually based on the Content-Type header.  However some websites do not set the correct 
Content-Type value for their content so not all of the appropriate content viewers are available.  Configuring
appropriate viewer content type mappings for these locations will allow you to view these requests with the
best possible viewers.
</p>

<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>
When a request that matches one of the configured mappings is viewed within Charles any viewers that are appropriate
for the configured viewer content type are enabled in addition to the automatically detected viewers.  No changes are
made to the actual request or response.
