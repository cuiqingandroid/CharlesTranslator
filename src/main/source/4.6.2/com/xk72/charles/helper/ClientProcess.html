<h2>Client Process Tool</h2>
<p>The Client Process tool shows the name of the local client process that is responsible for
making each request. The client process will usually be your web browser, such as firefox.exe, but
there are many potentially unknown HTTP clients that the Client Process tool can help you discover.
</p>

<p>The client process name is displayed in the Notes area on each request.</p>

<p>
The Client Process tool is useful if you
can see requests in Charles that you're not sure of the origin process. It
only works for requests originating on the computer on which Charles is running.
</p>

<p>
This tool will introduce a short delay before each connection is accepted by Charles.
The delay is usually not noticeable or significant.
