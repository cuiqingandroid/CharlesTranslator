<h2>Map Remote Tool</h2>
<p>The Map Remote tool changes the request location, per the configured mappings, so that the response
is transparently served from the new location as if that was the original request.</p>
<p>This mapping enables you to serve all or part of one site from another. For example, you could serve
a subdirectory of one site for another with a mapping from xk72.com/charles/ to localhost/charlesdev/, 
or serve all files with a given suffix from another site with a mapping from xk72.com/*.php to localhost/charlesdev/.</p>

<h3>Usage Suggestions</h3>
<p>Map Remote is useful if you have a development version of a site and would like to be able to browse the live
site with some of the requests being served from development. For example, you may want to serve the css and images
directories from your development server. Use a mapping like live.com/css/ to dev.com/css/ or live.com/*.css to dev.com.

<h3>Mapping Types</h3>
<ul>
<li>You can map directory to directory, such as xk72.com/charles/ to localhost/charlesdev/</li>
<li>You can map file to file, such as xk72.com/charles/download.php to abc.com/testing/test.html</li>
<li>You can map directory with file pattern to directory, such as xk72.com/charles/*.php to localhost/charlesdev/</li>
</ul>

<p>If you don't specify a path in the destination mapping then the path part of the URL will not be changed. If you want
to map to the root directory, put a / in the destination path field.</p>

<h3>Map Local</h3>
<p>Also see the Map Local tool, which can serve requests from local files so you can use the latest development
files from your computer as if they were part of a remote website.</p>
