<h2>Remote Mapping</h2>
<p>A remote mapping consists of a Map From location and a Map To location.</p>

<h3>Map From</h3>
<p>The Map From location is a regular location pattern. See the section on Location matching below.</p>

<h3>Map To</h3>
<p>The Map To location specifies what to change about the original request. Any field left blank will be
left unchanged.</p>
<p>If a path is specified it should end with a /. The original request path will be made relative
to the Map From location pattern and then mapped to be relative to the Map To path.</p>
