<h2>Port Forwarding</h2>
<p>Port forwarding enables you to transparently forward a local TCP or UDP port to a
remote host and port. All the requests and responses on the port may be recorded in Charles.</p>

<p>The port forwarding traffic is recorded in Charles as a socket://host:port/ URL</p>

<p>
Port forwarding is useful if you have a non-HTTP application that you want to monitor with Charles.
Create a port forward to the original destination server and then connect the client application
to the local port; the port forwarding is transparent to the client application and enables you to
view the traffic in Charles where you previously may not have been able to.
</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>
<p>You can forward TCP port 2525 on your local host to port 25 on a remote host. Then when you connect to localhost:2525
Charles will transparently forward the traffic to the remote host as if you had connected directly. You will see
the traffic recorded in Charles as socket://localhost:2525/.
