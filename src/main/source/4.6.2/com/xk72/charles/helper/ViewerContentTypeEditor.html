<h2>Viewer Content Type Mapping</h2>
<p>A viewer content type mapping consists of a location match and the desired request and response viewer content type.</p>
<p>You may specify a desired request type or response type or both.  You may also specify neither a request or response
type in which case the mapping will have no effect.  It is more usual to specify a response type as you are more likely
to be interested in the viewing of response content than the request content (which is often empty)</p>

<h3>Viewer Content Types</h3>

<p>The viewer content types that may be selected relate to the types of specialised viewers that Charles has available
(e.g. XML, Javascript and Protocol Buffers) and not to generic MIME types.  For most of the viewer content types there is
no further information to specify, the exception to this is the Protocol Buffers content type.  When you select the 
Protocol Buffers content type you may specify the location (URL) of the protocol buffers descriptor file, the name of the
message type and whether the content is a single message or a delimited list of messages.</p>
