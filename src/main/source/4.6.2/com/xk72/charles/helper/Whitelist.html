<h2>White List Tool</h2>
<p>The White List tool lets you block all requests except those to selected locations. When a request is received by
Charles that does not match a white listed location Charles blocks the request.  You can choose whether Charles will 
simply close the connection from the browser or return an error page (with a 403 response) to the browser.</p>
<p>There is also a Black List tool for blocking only selected locations.
If a request matches both the Black List and White List then it is blocked.</p>
